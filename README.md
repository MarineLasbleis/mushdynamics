## Overview


## Installation

We used Anaconda to package and install the package, but you can also directly install python3 and the packages through pip3. 

Required packages are: numpy scipy pandas matplotlib pyyaml


## Tests

There is no unit test implemented yet. But there are one script with a list of small programs to visually test if the solvers are doing correct things and to compare the advection solvers. See tests.py .
